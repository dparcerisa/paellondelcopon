Ingredients
1 tbsp olive oil
2 chicken breasts fillets, cut into chunks
2 small onions, finely sliced
1 fat garlic clove, crushed
140g cooking chorizo, sliced
1 tsp turmeric
pinch of saffron
1 tsp paprika
300g paella rice
850ml hot chicken or vegetable stock
200g frozen peas
1 lemon, cut into wedges, to serve
½ small bunch of parsley, finely chopped, to serve

Method
STEP 1
Heat the olive oil in a deep frying pan over a high heat. Brown the chicken all over – don’t cook completely. Once browned, transfer to a plate.

STEP 2
Reduce the heat to low, add the onions and cook slowly until softened, about 10 mins. Add the garlic, stir for 1 min, then toss in the chorizo and fry until it releases its oils.

STEP 3
Stir in the spices, then tip in the rice. Stir to coat the rice in the oils and spices for about 2 mins, then pour in the stock. Bring to the boil, return the chicken to the pan and simmer for about 20 mins, stirring occasionally.

STEP 4
Add the peas to the pan and simmer for a further 5 mins until the rice is cooked and the chicken is tender. Season well and serve with the lemon and parsley.

NOTE: a paella with chorizo is not a paella
NOTE2: if you leave out the saffron and add chorizo you do not deserve to eat a real paella again in your life
