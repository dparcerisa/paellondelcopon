1 tablespoon refined coconut oil
1 sweet onion, chopped
4 garlic cloves, minced
2 chorizo sausages, cut in ¼” rounds
2 sweet potatoes, peeled
14 oz. diced fire roasted tomatoes
¾ cup chicken broth
Salt and pepper to taste
1 teaspoon smoked paprika
1 teaspoon saffron
½ lb. shrimp, peeled and deveined
½ lb. mussels, rinsed
½ lb. clams, rinsed
½ lemon, cut in wedges
Handful parsley, chopped for topping

INSTRUCTIONS
Place your coconut oil, onion, and garlic in your pan and cook over medium-high heat, stirring frequently, until the onion turns golden brown and is translucent. This should take about 7 – 10 minutes.
While the onion is cooking, spiralize your sweet potato with the smallest noodle blade.
Place the spiralized sweet potato in a food processor and pulse to chop the noodles up into rice. I did it in three batches so the rice didn’t turn to mush.
Once the onions are browned, add the sausage and cook for another couple minutes.
Add the sweet potato rice, diced tomatoes, chicken broth, and spices.
Keep the pan over medium-high heat and stir to combine and mix everything together.
Nuzzle the shrimp, mussels, and clams into the rice mixture and continue to cook until the shrimp become pink and the mussels and clams open, about 5 – 10 minutes.
If the mussels and clams don’t open, remove them from the pan and discard.
Squeeze a couple lemon slices on top and sprinkle with chopped parsley.
